**Summary**
In this project, I have created an alarm clock with the following features:
Add Alarm: You can set multiple alarms specifying the time and day of the week.
Delete Alarm: You can delete any existing alarm by selecting it from a list.
Snooze Alarm: You can snooze an alarm at 5-minute intervals, up to a maximum of 3 snoozes.
Get Current Date and Time

**Low-Level Design (LLD)**
1.) clock.js: Manages the current time display.
2.) AlarmClock.js: Manages the list of alarms, adding, deleting, and checking alarms.
3.) main.js: Provides the command line interface to interact with the alarm clock functionalities.

**Code Execution Process**
1.) Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2.) Run the following command in your terminal: **node ./main.js**
3.) Follow the steps shown in the terminal to add, delete, or snooze alarms.

**NOTE**
Please make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
